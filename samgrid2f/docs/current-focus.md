# Current Focus: ActionExecutor.gd Debug

## GameBoard.gd Refactoring Project (IN PROGRESS)

### Overview
Major architecture improvement project to reduce GameBoard.gd complexity by extracting functionality into dedicated manager classes.

**Original Problem**: GameBoard.gd had grown to 580+ lines, making it difficult to maintain and extend.

**Solution**: Extract functionality into specialized manager classes with proper separation of concerns.

### Progress Status

#### âœ… **Phase 1: ModeManager.gd - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: Successfully extracted and tested
- **File**: `GameBoard/ModeManager.gd` (109 lines)
- **Functionality**: Move/attack mode state management and transitions
- **Integration**: Fully functional with proper signal handling
- **Result**: GameBoard.gd reduced by ~40 lines

**Key Features**:
- Mode activation/cancellation (`activate_move_mode()`, `cancel_attack_mode()`)
- ESC key handling with proper priority logic
- Signal forwarding for UI coordination
- Clean state transitions between move/attack modes

#### âœ… **Phase 2: ActionExecutor.gd - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: Successfully extracted and integrated
- **File**: `GameBoard/ActionExecutor.gd` (195 lines)
- **Target**: All action execution logic (move, attack, skills, items)
- **Progress**: 100% complete, all issues resolved

**Successfully Extracted**:
- âœ… Movement execution with async support
- âœ… Attack execution with death handling
- âœ… Attack range visualization and target detection
- âœ… Unit death cleanup and board management
- âœ… Signal architecture (`unit_died`, `action_completed`)

**Issues Resolved**:
- âœ… **PathFinder Integration**: Complex relationship between flood-fill and A* pathfinding working correctly
- âœ… **Variable Scope**: Fixed all duplicate variable declarations
- âœ… **Parse Errors**: Resolved PathFinder constructor and type issues
- âœ… **Move Mode Bug**: Fixed movement not cancelling move mode after completion
- âœ… **Signal Flow**: All ActionExecutor signals properly connected and working

**Final Fix Applied**:
- **Problem**: After movement completion, units stayed in move mode allowing continuous movement
- **Solution**: Added `_mode_manager.cancel_move_mode()` call in GameBoard's `_on_action_completed()` for move actions
- **Result**: Movement now properly returns to Layer 1 (unit selected) state after completion

#### ðŸ“‹ **Phase 3: InputHandler.gd - PLANNED**
- **Status**: Not started - planned for next session
- **Target**: Cursor input handling and click coordination
- **Complexity**: High (intricate input state management)
- **Estimated Size**: ~80-100 lines extracted

**Planned Extraction**:
- Cursor accept/move handling (`_on_Cursor_accept_pressed`, `_on_Cursor_moved`)
- Click validation and timing logic
- Unit selection coordination
- Input state management during animations
- ESC key input processing

### Expected Final Results

**After All 3 Phases Complete**:
- **GameBoard.gd**: ~300-350 lines (down from 580+)
- **ModeManager.gd**: 109 lines (state management)
- **ActionExecutor.gd**: ~195 lines (action execution)
- **InputHandler.gd**: ~80-100 lines (input processing)

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class handles one concern
- **Easier Maintenance**: Bugs isolated to specific managers
- **Extensibility**: Adding skills/spells/items now has clear location
- **Testing**: Individual components can be unit tested
- **Code Review**: Smaller files easier to review and understand

### Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete ActionExecutor.gd** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Fix any remaining runtime errors
   - Test movement and attack functionality
   - Verify signal connections work correctly
   - Ensure PathFinder integration is stable

2. **Begin InputHandler.gd Extraction** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Extract cursor and click handling logic
   - Maintain input timing and validation
   - Preserve animation blocking behavior

3. **Final Integration Testing** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Complete gameplay testing of all systems
   - Verify no regression in existing functionality
   - Update documentation for new architecture

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility while significantly improving code maintainability and extensibility.
